                                        My first job was in Face To Face Direct Marketing where I started as a sales
                                        associate got promoted in the first two months to a leadership position, where i
                                        would now teach and train new associates how to do what I was doing which I was
                                        doing well, Then after five more months I got promoted to assistant manager
                                        stayed at that position for one year and five more months but, eventually wanted
                                        a different challenge more sales but less face to face interactions.

                                        Programming but I just would not believe that I could be able to do it myself.
                                        Most of my life I have been believing that I’m not good enough or smart enough
                                        basically the previous education places I had attended based results on who got
                                        it right first and who could memorise the most to get a pass and asking question
                                        makes you look stupid and more inferior. That is till I came to Codex I can
                                        confidently say they not only thought me how to write programs and the
                                        fundaments for front and back end development, but more than that they thought
                                        me how the brain works, how to think like logically just by knowing there three
                                        side of your brain and being mindful of which instance your on every-time. I
